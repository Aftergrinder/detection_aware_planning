## Discuss

You don't need to be a developer to help us improving SGTM; Feel free to start a discussion if you have an idea, an advice or if you want to share any resource that can help us make the product better.

## Develop

The project is probably(?) `go-gettable` with `go get moul.io/sgtm`; but we strongly suggest you to clone the repo somewhere and use the provided Makefile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgtm-club/sgtm
cd sgtm
make run
```

You will probably need to provide some tokens in a `config.txt` file or by passing command-line arguments.

Please, open an issue if you need help for setting-up your development environment.

## Translate the app
